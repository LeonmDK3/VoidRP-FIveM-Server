## Known Issues

I have had reports that there is some slight lag when you have rented a motel room, me myself experience no issues, however i am looking into it and hope to resolve it soon,
This is my first LUA Project ive tried, so still learning the ropes a bit.

## Future Plans
Making property inventorys independent, -- im hoping this will allow stash houses to become a thing in RP.
