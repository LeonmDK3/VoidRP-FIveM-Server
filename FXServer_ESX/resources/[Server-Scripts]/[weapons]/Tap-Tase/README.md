# Tap-Tase

Have you ever wanted to or ever needed to tase someone that was really close to you but couldn't because of how the game works? Now you can. 
This script allows you to tase someone that is close to you without having to shoot at them.

How does it work/How to use it.?
You need to be holding your taser and when you get close enough to another player, just press "E" (default key) and they will get "tased".
